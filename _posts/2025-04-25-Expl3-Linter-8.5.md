Today, I'm excited to announce another [update][2] to [_expltools_][1], the bundle that includes the static analysis tool _explcheck_ for the expl3 programming language. This update introduces initial support for **semantic analysis**. In this post, I‚Äôll explain what this means for expl3 programmers, what‚Äôs still missing, and where we're headed next.

In [a previous post][3], I introduced [a public website][4] listing issues in current TeX Live packages detected by _explcheck_. This time, I‚Äôll also talk about how I‚Äôve been using that resource to collaborate with package authors and help fix real-world issues.

# What is semantic analysis?

Semantic analysis builds on the results of **syntactic analysis** (covered in [my last post][5]) by interpreting recognized function calls as high-level statements and performing additional processing based on their type.

For example, consider this expl3 snippet, which prints ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù when executed:

    \cs_new:Nn
      \example_foo:n
      {
        \cs_new:Nn
          \example_bar:n
          {
            #1,~##1!
          }
      }
    \example_foo:n { Hello }
    \example_bar:n { world }

Semantic analysis identifies three top-level statements here:

1. The definition of the function `\example_foo:n`.
2. A call to `\example_foo:n` with the argument ‚ÄúHello‚Äù.
3. A call to another user-defined function, `\example_bar:n`, with the argument ‚Äúworld‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the first one.

The definition of `\example_foo:n` contains parameter tokens like `#1`. During semantic analysis, these are replaced with ‚ü®argument‚ü© pseudo-tokens to represent the values inserted during a function call. Doubled parameter characters (`##`) are simplified to single ones (`#`). After this transformation, the inner function definition becomes:

    \cs_new:Nn
      \example_bar:n
      {
        ‚ü®argument‚ü©,~#1!
      }

This replacement text is then re-analyzed syntactically and semantically, producing one nested statement:

1. The definition of the function `\example_bar:n`.

This nested definition is processed again, yielding the fully transformed replacement text:

```latex
‚ü®argument‚ü©,~‚ü®argument‚ü©!
```

However, no further nested statements are found.

# What does this mean for expl3 programmers?

Until now, _explcheck_ only analyzed top-level function calls. With this update, it also parses replacement texts inside function definitions. This allows issues from Section 3 of [Warnings and errors for the expl3 analysis tool][6] to be detected not just at the top level, but also within functions.

That said, semantic analysis currently recognizes only function definitions. Other constructs‚Äîsuch as variable declarations, function variant generation, or key-value assignments‚Äîare not yet interpreted. As a result, issues described in Section 4 of the same document are still out of scope. Expect support for (some of) these in the next release.

# Working with the community

In March, I reached out to the maintainers of five packages with issues listed on [our website][4]:

1. [BITNP/BIThesis#604](https://github.com/BITNP/BIThesis/issues/604)
2. [jspitz/jslectureplanner#7](https://github.com/jspitz/jslectureplanner/issues/7)
3. [dbitouze/nwejm#5](https://github.com/dbitouze/nwejm/issues/5)
4. [dbitouze/gzt#56](https://github.com/dbitouze/gzt/issues/56)
5. [michal-h21/responsive-latex#1](https://github.com/michal-h21/responsive-latex/issues/1)

Thanks to the maintainers‚Äô quick responses, three of these issues have already been resolved!

Following today‚Äôs update, six more issues were found in TeX Live packages with public repositories. I‚Äôve submitted reports to their maintainers as well:

6. [fpantigny/nicematrix#12](https://github.com/fpantigny/nicematrix/issues/12)  
7. [josephwright/siunitx#796](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/issues/796)  
8. [BITNP/BIThesis#640](https://github.com/BITNP/BIThesis/issues/640)  
9. [se2p/se2thesis#23](https://github.com/se2p/se2thesis/issues/23)  
10. [John02139/asmeconf#11](https://github.com/John02139/asmeconf/issues/11)  
11. [dickimaw-books.com#303](https://dickimaw-books.com/bugtracker.php?key=303)

One of these has already been fixed‚Äîbefore I even finished writing this post. Let‚Äôs see how many more we can fix before the next update! üòâ
