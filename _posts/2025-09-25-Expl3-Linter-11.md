Today, I'm excited to release the next major [update][2] to [_expltools_][1], a bundle that includes the static analysis tool _explcheck_ for the expl3 programming language. This update improves upon the **semantic analysis** processing step introduced in the [previous post][3] and lays groundwork for the final processing step of **flow analysis**.

# Inter-file dependencies

The original [project proposal][4] assumed that files would be checked individually. In practice, this limited the **semantic analysis** of multi-file projects, where one file defines a symbol and another uses it. To address this, the new release introduces the concept of _file groups_: sets of files that are assumed to be used together.

For example, suppose we have a file `foo.tex`:

    \cs_new:Nn
      \__example_foo:n
      { foo }
    \cs_generate_variant:Nn
      \__example_foo:n
      { V }

and another file `bar.tex`:

    \__example_foo:V
      \l_tmpa_tl

Previously, running `explcheck foo.tex bar.tex` produced:

    Checking 2 files

    Checking foo.tex                                         1 warning

        foo.tex:4:1:              W402 unused private function variant

    Checking bar.tex                                           1 error

        bar.tex:1:1:                E408 calling an undefined function

    Total: 1 error, 1 warning in 2 files

With the new release, files from the same directory are automatically grouped, and the result changes to:

    Checking 2 files

    Checking foo.tex                                                OK
    Checking bar.tex                                                OK

    Total: 0 errors, 0 warnings in 2 files

This greatly reduces false positives.

You can control this behavior with the `--group-files` option or by using `+` and `,` between filenames to group or separate them.

In addition, _explcheck_ will report missing symbols from external packages. To suppress these, use the `imported_prefixes` option in your configuration.

# Segments

Earlier versions of _explcheck_ had special-case support for only one kind of nested code: function replacement texts. For instance, consider the example from a [previous post][5]:

    \cs_new:Nn
      \example_foo:n
      {
        \cs_new:Nn
          \example_bar:n
          {
            #1,~##1!
          }
      }
    \example_foo:n { Hello }
    \example_bar:n { world }

Here we have three top-level calls (`\cs_new:Nn`, `\example_foo:n`, `\example_bar:n`) and two replacement texts.

But expl3 contains many more forms of nested code: `T`- and `F`-branches of conditional functions, loop bodies (e.g., `\ior_map_inline:Nn`), keyâ€“value definitions, and more. Ad-hoc support for each would be brittle, and the upcoming **flow analysis** requires a uniform way to connect code across different nesting types and levels.

To address this, the new release introduces _segments_, a unified representation for both top-level and nested code. This simplifies implementation and makes future extensions easier.

{% include image.html url="er-diagram.svg" thumburl="er-diagram.png"
   description="Entity relationship diagram of the analysis data model, highlighting our representation of input files." %}

The first new segment type added is [support for `T`- and `F`-branches of conditional functions][6], and future updates will continue expanding segment coverage.

# Code coverage

To show how well _explcheck_ understands a piece of code, the `--verbose` output now reports **code coverage**: the ratio of _well-understood_ expl3 tokens to the total number of tokens. A token is well-understood if it is either simple text or part of a recognized statement in the most deeply nested segment containing it.

For example:

    \cs_new:Nn
      \example_baz:n
      { \unexpected }
    some~text

- The nine tokens in `some~text` are well-understood (simple text).
- The four tokens `\cs_new:Nn`, `\example_baz:n`, `{`, and `}` are well-understood (recognized statement).
- The token `\unexpected` is _not_ well-understood, because there are no recognized statements in the replacement text.

Thus, coverage = 13/14 tokens â‰ˆ 93%.

For context, _explcheck_ currently achieves ~14% code coverage across all expl3 code in TeX Live. Future releases aim to raise this figure by recognizing more statements, segment types, and plain TeX / LaTeX2e constructs.

# Working with the community
