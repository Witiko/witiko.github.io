I did a remix of the Persona 3 “Mass Destruction” theme from the “Burn My Dread
-Reincarnation: Persona 3-” album by Shoji Meguro (Atlus) and two versions of
“Megalovania” from Undertale and Homestuck by Toby Fox.

The drawings of Sans and Gaster Blaster were kindly provided by [Sallintha][].
The animation was created using [Synfig Studio][] – a free open-source
animation software that provides command-line rendering.  All the assets and
project files are available in a [Git repository][] along with the two other
remixes of the songs I did earlier.
