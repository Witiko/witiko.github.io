Today, I'm excited to announce another [update][2] to [_expltools_][1], the bundle that includes the static analysis tool _explcheck_ for the expl3 programming language. This release significantly extends support for the **semantic analysis** processing step.

In this post, I'll explain what this means for expl3 programmers, what functionality is still missing, and provide a realistic estimate for when full support for **semantic** (and **flow**) **analysis** can be expected. I'll also discuss how this impacts the project roadmap.

Additionally, I'd like to tease a [work-in-progress article][8] titled *Expltools: Development tools for expl3 programmers*, forthcoming in TUGboat 46(2) or (3), along with my upcoming [talk][9] this July at [TUG 2025][7] in India.

Finally, as a follow-up to the previous [two][3] [posts][4], in which I described how I collaborated with package authors to fix issues detected by _explcheck_, I'll provide updates on the status of those tickets.

# What are the new features?

As discussed in [my previous post][4], the initial **semantic analysis** implementation laid the foundation but did not yet report any new issues. The latest release changes that, introducing support for six issues from Section 4.1 of [_Warnings and errors for the expl3 analysis tool_][5]:

 1. **W401**: Unused private function
 2. **W402**: Unused private function variant
 3. **T403**: Function variant of incompatible type
 4. **E404**: Protected predicate function
 5. **E405**: Function variant for an undefined function
 6. **W407**: Multiply defined function variant

This accounts for roughly one quarter of all issues planned for the **semantic analysis**.

# What is taking so long?

The original [project proposal][6] assumed that each of the five processing steps would take about two months to implement, with a two-month buffer for unforeseen work. This assumption held for the first three steps:

- **Preprocessing**: 2 months (Oct–Nov 2024)
- **Lexical analysis**: 1.5 months (Dec–mid Jan 2025)
- _**Housekeeping and bugfixes**: 1.5 months (mid Jan–Feb)_
- **Syntactic analysis**: 1 month (March)

By contrast, **semantic analysis** has already taken two full months, and we're only a quarter of the way through its planned issues—despite the fact that I've spent significantly more time on the project this month than in any of the previous seven.

Why the delay? The short answer is: **semantic analysis** is hard. This step is responsible for approximately 36% of all planned issues—nearly double what would be expected if the issues were evenly distributed.

Moreover, it's the first step where all accumulated knowledge must be combined to detect higher-level problems. While previous steps focused on parsing and data collection, **semantic analysis** is where the real analysis begins.

It may even be more challenging than the final **flow analysis** step, where full implementation may not be feasible due to gaps in knowledge, as discussed in Section 4.3 of [the proposal][6].

If we weight the remaining steps by the number of planned issues (halving the expected effort for **flow analysis**) and fit the work into the original 10-month timeframe, we arrive at this estimate:

- **Semantic analysis**: 4 months (April–July 2025, concluding around [TUG 2025][7])
- **Flow analysis**: 2 months (Aug–Sep 2025)

However, this may still be optimistic. If it takes two months to complete just one quarter of **semantic analysis** issues, a pessimistic projection would suggest a total of eight months—pushing the final release of _explcheck_ to January 2026.

# Working with the community

Since March, I've been actively reaching out to package maintainers and developers to report issues identified by _explcheck_. Out of eleven reported issues, seven have been resolved:

1. [BITNP/BIThesis#604](https://github.com/BITNP/BIThesis/issues/604): fixed
2. [jspitz/jslectureplanner#7](https://github.com/jspitz/jslectureplanner/issues/7): fixed
3. [dbitouze/nwejm#5](https://github.com/dbitouze/nwejm/issues/5)
4. [dbitouze/gzt#56](https://github.com/dbitouze/gzt/issues/56)
5. [michal-h21/responsive-latex#1](https://github.com/michal-h21/responsive-latex/issues/1): fixed
6. [fpantigny/nicematrix#12](https://github.com/fpantigny/nicematrix/issues/12): fixed
7. [josephwright/siunitx#796](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/issues/796): wontfix
8. [BITNP/BIThesis#640](https://github.com/BITNP/BIThesis/issues/640): fixed
9. [se2p/se2thesis#23](https://github.com/se2p/se2thesis/issues/23)
10. [John02139/asmeconf#11](https://github.com/John02139/asmeconf/issues/11): fixed
11. [dickimaw-books.com#303](https://dickimaw-books.com/bugtracker.php?key=303): fixed

As of today's release, no additional errors have been found in TeX Live packages with public repositories, only warnings.

Thank you for your attention and stay tuned for more updates as _explcheck_ continues to evolve!
