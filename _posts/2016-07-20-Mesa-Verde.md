Today, we are headed to the Mesa Verde National Park, where the dwellings of the Ancestral Pueblo people, who called Mesa Verde their home during 500s--1300s A.D., can be found. Perhaps most fascinating are the cliff dwellings built in the alcoves in the surrounding canyon sides, where the Ancestral Pueblo people retreated from the mesa tops during the 1200s. Shortly after that the people disappeared -- presumably due to a long period of droughts, as evidenced by the annuli of the well-preserved pine logs that were used to support the building roofs, or an internal struggle.
