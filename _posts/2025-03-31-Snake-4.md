Three weeks ago, I [released][2] my classic browser-based snake game&thinsp;—&thinsp;a project
I started 15 years ago&thinsp;—&thinsp;under a free and open-source license.

In my previous [two][1] [posts][3], I introduced the various systems that power
the game and how they interact. Today, I’ll dive into the game’s design, its
influences, and the underlying technologies.

# Design and influences

The core game loop&thinsp;—&thinsp;collecting food and chasing time-limited rare items&thinsp;—&thinsp;draws
inspiration from the snake game pre-installed on Nokia 3410 cell phones. The
minimalist, square-based design echoes the mobile game _Edge (2008)_. There’s
no clutter of menus or HUDs; the initial speed selection is all you see, and
total points appear as floating numbers when you eat food, eliminating the need
for a constant score display.

The concept of color-coded rare items takes cues from classic Blizzard
titles like _Diablo (1996)_, _Diablo II (2000)_, and _World of Warcraft
(2004)_. Meanwhile, the flashy, attention-grabbing achievement texts&thinsp;—&thinsp;designed
to distract and challenge your focus on navigating the board&thinsp;—&thinsp;are a nod to the
Swedish PC game _Icy Tower (2001)_.

# Technology

The game was built with ECMAScript 3 and basic web APIs to ensure compatibility
with even older browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6.

- **Adaptive game board:** The screen size is detected via the
  [`screen.js`][11] library, allowing the game board to adjust dynamically.

- **Modern JavaScript features:** Although the game is built on ECMAScript 3,
  ECMAScript 5 features have been polyfilled using [`ecma5.js`][4].
  Additionally, my custom language extensions are provided via [`comp.js`][9]
  and [`math.js`][10].

- **Persistent user data:** User preferences&thinsp;—&thinsp;like the chosen snake speed&thinsp;—&thinsp;are
  stored using cookies or the [Storage web API][5] when available. Transparent
  access to these settings is ensured by [`cookie.js`][6], [`userData.js`][7],
  and [`localStorage.js`][8], regardless of the underlying storage mechanism.

- **Animations and visual effects:** Animations&thinsp;—&thinsp;including movement, scaling,
  rotation, and glow effects on achievement texts, food color transitions, and
  day-to-night theme shifts&thinsp;—&thinsp;are handled by [`graphics.js`][12],
  [`effects.js`][13], [`skin.js`][14], and [`sunset.js`][15].

Each of these libraries was custom-built for the game, representing both a
technical challenge and a creative outlet.
