[Two weeks ago][1], I announced the first public release of [_expltools_][2], a bundle that includes _explcheck_, a static analysis tool for the expl3 programming language.

Since then, the project has sparked a lively discussion in [the project repository][3], engaging early adopters, contributors, and enthusiasts. This feedback loop has already resulted in [two][4] [new][5] releases within the past two weeks, and another update is planned for next Monday (December 23).

On December 14, I also had the opportunity to present _explcheck_ during [a talk][6] at the general assembly of the Czechoslovak TeX Users Group (CSTUG). Although the talk was delivered in Czech, the [presentation slides][7] are in English and should provide a clear overview of the topics discussed.

Looking ahead to January, once the initial wave of feedback from the first release has been addressed, I plan to start implementing the next major processing step for _explcheck_: **lexical analysis**. This step involves converting the expl3 parts identified during preprocessing into TeX tokens, paving the way for deeper program analysis.

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback via [the project repository][3].
