Today, we are headed to the Antelope Canyons in the Navajo Tribal Park. The entrance fees are pretty steep ($46 + $8 tribal fee per a visitor) and the ride on the back of an all-terain vehicle to the entrance to the upper canyon is fairly uncomfortable with all the sand flying around. The sights, however, are well worth the trouble.

The entrance to the lower canyon is closer to the parking lot, so we could approach it on foot. The entrance fees are much more reasonable ($20 + $8 tribal fee per a visitor), the canyon is equally stuning but longer, and there is a cafe at the parking lot. If you are time-pressed, I suggest you skip the upper canyon in favour of the lower one.

After leaving the Antelope Canyons, we moved to the nearby Glen Canyon Dam. The original plan was to spend some time swimming in Lake Powell, but the plan was altered due to time constraints.

After visiting the dam visitors center and enjoying the sights of the dam, the lake, and the adjacent Navajo Bridge, we moved to the Valle city. Valle is located right at the southern rim of the Grand Canyon, which we are going to visit tomorrow.
