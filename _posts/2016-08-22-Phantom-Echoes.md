While I was watching the first volume of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Diamond is
Unbreakable, I fell in love with the battle theme of Koichi Hirose ([Yuuki][])
and wondered what a remix with the intro theme of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure:
Phantom Blood ([Sono Chi no Sadame][]) would sound like. Since the JoJo's
Bizzare Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable OST [got released][release] on July
27th, I decided to throw together a quick prototype.

As you may have noticed, the Sono Chi no Sadame part of the remix has been
slowed down noticeably. This was necessary, since Yuuki and Sono Chi no Sadame
are more than two semitones apart. Luckily, Sono Chi no Sadame was sampled at
48 kHz, which allowed me to losslessly close most of the gap by playing it at
44.1 kHz.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how well the two tracks go together. If I
manage to find some time, I would like to make the remix longer and mix in the
[Stardust Crusaders][] track from the third part of the JoJo's Bizzare
Adventures, which I suspect might also work well with both Yuuki and Sono Chi
no Sadame.
