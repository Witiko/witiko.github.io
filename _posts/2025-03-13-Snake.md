In the late 2000s, I was an [active member][2] of the Czech bulletin board <https://diskuse.jakpsatweb.cz>, a vibrant space where hobbyists, academics, and professionals shared ideas about web development.

On July 29, 2010, I introduced an early version of a web browser game called **DHTML Snake** in a [forum post][1]. In that post, I explained the gameâ€™s systems, implementation details, and invited feedback. Over the next couple of years, I incrementally improved the game by following my own creative direction and incorporating suggestions from high school classmates.

After more than a decade without updates, I revisited the project yesterday. I cleaned up the code and released it under a free, open-source license on [GitHub][3].

You can try the game [here][4] using your computerâ€™s keyboard and mouse. ðŸ¤ž

The GitHub repository doesnâ€™t just host the latest version&thinsp;â€”&thinsp;it also features [four historical versions of the game][7] that showcase its evolution over time.

Shortly after the update, I promptly [fixed][6] a long-standing [bug][5] related to using Geolocation for the in-game day-and-night cycle. If time permits, I plan to follow up later this month with a detailed post-mortem discussing the gameâ€™s journey and exploring potential future developments.
