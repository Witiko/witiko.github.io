Between family holiday, my wife's trip to Кыргызстан, freelance work, and [TUG 2024][5], I have had precious little time for [the project][4] since [my previous post][2].

In the past month, I opened [a repository][1] with project documentation and I [registered the expl3 prefix `expltools`][3] that will be used in the documentation and any other expl3 code used in the project.

Furthermore, at TUG 2024, I discussed [neovim][8]'s support for [language servers][9] with Michal Hoftich. Michal helped me realize that language servers are static analysis tools and that at least two language servers for TeX exist: [TeXLab][6] and [digestif][7]. Both language servers focus on document markup, cannot analyse expl3 code and therefore don't meet [the project requirements][2] (yet). However, they are still related work and should be taken into consideration in the design of my tool.

Ideally, I would be able to contribute code to one of the language servers to make it work with expl3 code. This would be likely digestif, which is written in Lua and which already supports different TeX formats with different catcode regimes such as LaTeX, ConTeXt, and plain TeX. Alternatively, if the scope is too different, reusing some code and design from the existing language servers should still save time. Regardless, my tool should either support the language server protocol (LSP) directly or be designed in a way that makes it easy to write an LSP wrapper for it. This way, my tool can be used not just from the command line but also to highlight errors in text editors.

In August, I plan to update the project requirements to include support for the LSP and a short section about related work. Then, I will analyze the requirements, discuss the design of the linter, and start the implementation.
