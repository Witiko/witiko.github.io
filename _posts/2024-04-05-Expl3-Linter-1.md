In 2021, I used [the expl3 programming language][7] for the first time. At that time, I had already been eyeing expl3 for some time and when it came to defining a LaTeX-specific interface for processing YAML metadata in [version 2.11.0][1] of [the Markdown Package for TeX][2], I took the plunge. After three and a half years, approximately 3.5k out of the 5k lines of TeX code in [Markdown Package 3.5.0][3] is written in expl3 and I have already written [three][4] [journal][5] [articles][6] for my local TeX users group about expl3. Needless to say, I enjoy programming in expl3 very much!

In the Markdown package, each change is reviewed by a number of automated static analysis tools (so-called *linters*), which look for programming errors in the code. While these tools don't catch all programming errors, they have proven extremely useful in catching the typos that inevitably start trickling in after 2AM. Since the Markdown package contains code in different programming languages, we use many different linters such as [`shellcheck`][8] for shell scripts, [`luacheck`][9] for Lua, and [`flake8`][10] and [`pytype`][11] for Python. However, since no linters for expl3 exist, typos in expl3 code are often only caught by regression tests, human reviewers, or, in some cases, our users following a release, which is a giant bummer.

Last month, I realized that, unlike TeX, expl3 has the following two properties that seem to make it well-suited for static analysis:

1. Simple uniform syntax: (Almost) all operations are expressed as function calls. This Lisp-like quality makes is easy to convert well-behaved expl3 programs that only use high-level interfaces into abstract syntax trees, which is a prerequisite for static analysis.
2. Explicit type and scope: Variables and constants are separate from functions. Each variable is either local or global. Variables and constants are explicitly typed. This information makes it easy to detect common programming errors related to the incorrect use of variables.

I have a background in formal language theory and compiler design and I always wanted to know more about the related fields of software verification and analysis. Therefore, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and build myself a linter for expl3.

This is the first in a series of posts, in which I will create a simple linter for well-behaved expl3 programs. In the next post, I will design the components of the linter and hallucinate about the types of programming errors the different components will allow us to recognize.
